Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) are closely related fields within computer science, but they have distinct differences.



Artificial Intelligence is a broader concept that involves creating intelligent machines capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as visual perception, speech recognition, decision-making, and natural language processing. AI encompasses various methods, including rule-based systems, expert systems, and machine learning algorithms. AI systems can be designed to work autonomously or with minimal human intervention, depending on the complexity of the task.



Machine Learning, on the other hand, is a subset of AI that focuses on teaching machines to learn from data without being explicitly programmed. ML algorithms can identify patterns and trends in data and use them to make predictions and decisions. ML is primarily used for pattern recognition, predictive modeling, and decision-making in fields such as marketing, fraud detection, and credit scoring.
